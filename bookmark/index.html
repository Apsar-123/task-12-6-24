            <strong>The cloud is a network of servers</strong>, software, and databases that are accessed over the internet. It's made up of                    
            remote servers in data centers around the world that are connected to operate as a single system. Cloud computing  
            is the on-demand availability of these resources as services over the internet.

        <strong>A private cloud is a cloud computing</strong> environment that is dedicated to a single organization or customer. In a private
        cloud, the organization controls and maintains all cloud resources, including compute resources like CPU and storage,
        which are provisioned on demand through a self-service portal. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises, off-premises,
        or on IT infrastructure rented from a cloud provider.

        What is a Private Cloud? - Amazon AWS
        A private cloud is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization. Any cloud infrastructure has
        underlying compute resources like CPU and storage that you provision on demand through a self-service portal. In a
        private cloud, all resources are isolated and in the control of one organization.

        What's the Difference Between Public Cloud and Private Cloud?
        In a private cloud, a single organization controls and maintains the underlying infrastructure to deliver the IT
        resources. In a public cloud, external cloud providers deliver the resources as a fully managed service. For example,
        applications require computing resources like internal memory, data storage, and CPU.

        <strong>A public cloud is a model of computing services</strong> that are made available to individuals and organizations over the
        internet by third-party providers. These services can include storage, applications, and develop-and-deploy
        environments. Public cloud services can be free or sold on-demand, with customers paying only for the resources they
        use, such as storage, CPU cycles, or bandwidth. This pay-as-you-go model can help companies reduce costs.

        The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them
        available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay
        only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.

                    <strong>A hybrid cloud is a computing environment</strong> that combines a public cloud with an on-premises data center, also
                    known as a private cloud. This allows data and applications to be shared between the two environments.
                    Hybrid clouds can offer several benefits, including:
                    <u><b>Flexibility</b></u> 
                    Companies can adjust their infrastructure to work with different types of data in different environments
                    Cost management
                    Organizations don't have to own and operate the data center infrastructure, which can be expensive
                    Agility and scalability
                    Public cloud providers offer more resource options than an organization's physical data center
                    Resiliency and interoperability
                    Businesses can run workloads redundantly in both private and public environments.
